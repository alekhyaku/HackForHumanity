# About
This website was made in order to provide resources and opportunities for those who were affected by natural disasters and those who want to help. It would be updated frequently with the newest information relative to each location. People can search based on their State, City, and Type. Type represents donation types, volunteer, or organization. These represent the three types of information we provide. Organization will be able to post opportunities for all types listed previously similar to Handshake. In the Figma demo, you can click on the drop down for state and click the logo in the top right corner to learn more about our purpose.
